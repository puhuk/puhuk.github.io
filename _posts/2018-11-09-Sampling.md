There is a term "Sampling" in statistics. In this page, will see the concept of sampling and how it is adjusted to machine learning.

### Description
Sampling means selection of observations to acquire some knowledge of a statistical population.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling))

In statistics, when complete enumeration for population is impossible or requires quiet a few resources, than select subset of population to have a knowledge of a population. So it should representative the statistical population well.

### Kinds of sampling
- Ramdom sampling : Literally select samples from population randomly. 
- Ramdom sampling with replacement : It can include same sample for several times
- Ramdom sampling without replacement : After selection, do not put the sample into the population again. So no chance to select same sample
- Downsampling : Select less from bigger data set to reduce high-frequency items.
- Upsampling : Select more from less data set
For example, assume there are 6 data as {0,0,0,0,1,1}.
When downsampling, takes 2 0s and 2 1s.
When upsampling, takes 4 0s and 4 1s.
